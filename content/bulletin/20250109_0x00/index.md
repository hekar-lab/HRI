Due to the {{< redacted 7 >}} incident our phone line has been destabilized. Our
experts on telecommunication and chaos are working diligently to restore it. For
the time being Lorenz attractors have been installed in an effort to bring back the line.
It is not advised to try to contact us through that mean as it could lead to
unpredictable outcomes.
