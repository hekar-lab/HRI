It just is. Think about it.

Firstly, as far as we know ***π*** is a normal number[^norm]. Meaning, digits are distributed uniformly
amongst its decimal -- that is each digit is as likely to appear at any decimal (i.e 1 out of 10 chance).  
We've looked 314,000,000,000,000 deep into the decimals of ***π*** and from what we've
gathered it seems to behave as we'd except from such a number. 

A palindrome is defined as: 

> "a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards"[^pal]

For example, number-wise, 101 is a palindrome.  
There is immediately an issue with this definition: how does one read an infinite number backward?  
This reflection is as foolish as it is close-minded. Yes, palindrome are ill-defined for infinite
sequences but that does not stop us from using our brains and try to imagine what it could mean 
for those cases.

9 is a palindrome, 99 is a palindrome, 999 also, etc. Thus 9999... ad infinitum could also be said
to be a palindrome. Thus, when it comes to infinite palindromes, you just need to be a bit
more creative.

Back to ***π***. As it is a normal number, any sequence of any length is as probable to appear
as any other sequence of the same length. So if we want a point of inversion where ***π*** runs
the sequence so far in reverse we need to get lucky. But when it comes to infinity luck is meaningless.
***π*** will reverse at some point.  
Then what? If that's the case then ***π*** is finite. Not to fret, my boy! ***π*** will then
continue as *normal* which means that as some point this there will be another inversion point!
Then another, and another, ad infinitum! This means that ***π*** IS a palindrome! I'm right!
And all you non-believer will have to live in the shadow of my greatness!

See you later, suckers!
