{{< censored >}}It has come to our attention we are most likely using illegal numbers{{< /censored >}}[^ill] 
at the H.R.I.  
{{< censored >}} This is, of course, unacceptable.{{< /censored >}} The H.R.I. has a duty to keep every activity 
above board. As there is a lot of confusion {{< censored >}}on what constitute an illegal number{{< /censored >}}, 
this will serve as a remainder.

## An introduction to ██████████████

{{< censored >}}An illegal number is defined{{< /censored >}} as follows:

> {{< censored >}}An illegal number is a number that represents information which is illegal to possess, utter, propagate, or otherwise transmit in some legal jurisdiction.{{< /censored >}}

As any digital information {{< censored >}}can be represented as a number many numbers are illegal.{{< /censored >}}

The simplest way to create {{< censored >}}an illegal number would be to take any media file containing
illegal data then convert its binary representation to a decimal one{{< /censored >}}.

{{< sign danger >}}
This should be reproduced under any circumstances.
{{< /sign >}}

{{< censored >}}There are, however, many other ways a number can be illegal. For example, if a number
is a dog whistle{{< /censored >}}[^dog] {{< censored >}}it may be rendered illegal depending on what it refers to.{{< /censored >}}  
{{< censored >}}This reference principle{{< /censored >}} brings us to the next topic.

## Almost all ███████ are ███████

Almost all numbers {{< censored >}}are normal numbers{{< /censored >}}[^nor]{{< censored >}}. Which means that any number sequence of any
length may occur at a point within the decimal with a non-zero chance. This, clearly, is an issue.
This property means that at a given point for any normal number it will contain illegal information.
As a matter of fact all normal numbers contain all illegal information there is and will be.{{< /censored >}}  
It thus goes {{< censored >}}that those numbers are prohibited.{{< /censored >}}

[^nor]: [█████████ article on ██████ number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number)

This leaves us with {{< censored >}}integers, rational numbers and abnormal numbers. But as it is hard 
to prove that an irrational number is abnormal -- and even harder to prove it does
not contain illegal information -- only the former two are left -- just to be safe{{< /censored >}}.

But, {{< censored >}}integers can be used to reference a place in the decimals of a number. This
means that any integer can reference illegal data contained within a specific number.
So, as was done before, we should also ban integers. And thus also ban rational numbers
which are just a pair of integers -- potentially twice as illegal!{{< /censored >}}

{{< censored >}}This would leave us with nothing but we where able to strike a deal with authorities 
so that they would let us use *0*.{{< /censored >}} Thus *0* is the only allowed number from now on.

Please change your work in accordance to this new regulation.
