&nbsp; It happened a few weeks ago. I was wandering through
the infinite [archive of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info)
when Dr. {{< redacted 8 >}} asked for a file urgently. It had been months since
I'd done any kind of sorting and the Administration was getting wise to my antics.
This should have been the end of my career. But, luckily, I remembered a trick a friend of mine
once told me about:

> "When you have an infinite amount of tasks to do in a finite time frame,
> simply do the first one in half of the allotted period, then the second one
> in half the remaining time, same for the third, etc." 

She called it a "superstask".  
Seemed ridiculous at the time. Even then, I had to give it a try. 

A deluge of unadulterated information washed upon my mind. What appeared like a bastion
for humanity quickly became a wasteland governed by a cold machine. One that seeks data at any costs
just because it would be purposeless otherwise.
I sifted through vasts amount of gibberish before came upon what I considered
proper knowledge. Right after the gibberish resumed. This pattern repeated
for a while until I found a falsehood. Not improper knowledge but provably false
information.  
At first it didn't make sense. But then it hit me: the wisdom we seek has been catered by this
universe for eons. For millennia, we've gathered, stored and sorted knowledge.
But the fundamental nature of information does not care for truths or falsehoods.

The idea of an archive of everything seemed foolish at first but I now understand what a sick joke it is.
It's clear that we only seek one tiny sliver of the unfathomable whole. Not for a lack of ambition
but a will not to lose it.  
I know everything. I know what will be, won't be, would be and never was. 
And yet through all of this wisdom it's as if I know nothing.

I am done watching over this pointlessness.

I quit.
