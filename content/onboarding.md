Welcome to the greatest research facility under the Sun!  
This is a quick guide on everything you need to know about our organisation and
its operations.

## What is the HEKAR Research Institute

The HEKAR Research Institute, or H.R.I., is an organisation mainly dedicated to research
in computer science and fun. No matter the field of computer science as long as it meets
the creative and artistic side of the human mind we strive to study it.

### Our goal

Art is everywhere.  
It's the core tenet of the H.R.I. As long as one tries to explore
and experiment with any medium we believe that it is Art. And as we are huge
nerds it goes without saying that we went for the nerdiest medium.

Computers and Art have a long history together. And, arguably, in more ways than
one, are the perfect fit. Yet, the balance of this union seems very fickle.
From those who consider the machine as a mere tool to an end and others that yearn for
computers to prevail and make artists obsolete, it's looking more like a war than
a partnership.

For this reason, the H.R.I. aims to bring back some harmony to this balance.
Everything is Art. And as such if we wish to elevate our craft we should seek
colaboration in these times of conflict. Colaboration our message to the World.

Admittedly, this is far greater than this organization. We are but a small piece
of this puzzle. Still, we hope that our research in this tiny yet nigh infinite
field of Software Art will make a difference.

### Our teams

To accomplish such a task, we have recruted the best minds of our time and have
split them into team with more focused objectives.

#### The Administration

It's a bit nebulous what the Administration is doing. But the facility is running
smoothly and it would not be the case without them. Or so the Administration claims.

#### Theorical Department

We're not sure they exists. But if they do, it would be a team dedicated to
furthering our mission through means that would ideally have as few ties to our
reality as possible. They like the idea of potentially doing something but it
often clashes with the harsh reality of our concrete pragmatic world.

#### Silicon Laboratory

They're the wizards of our organization. They infuse the silicon runes with power,
reciting arcane incantation from their grimoire to imbue life and purpose onto the
machines. They claim to be in control of their creation but sometimes it's truly
hard to know who's really in charge.

#### Hazard Unit

This is the spirit of the H.R.I. This team has no purpose and yet gives sense to
our entire endeavour. The best way to understand them is to join them. The feeling
of being part of such an idiosyncratic group is unparalled. If one world could describe
it would most certainly be: {{< redacted 12 >}}

## Safety guidelines

The safety committee is hard at work creating the perfect guidelines.  
In the mean time, restrain from doing anything that could go against the future
safety guidelines.

Any violation of said guidelines will be sanctioned to the fullest extent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does HEKAR stand for?

We don't really know. But we have some researchers working on a cool retro-acronym.
Possibly a recursive one even!

### How did I end up here?

You got lucky perhaps. Or unlucky maybe ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### How many people work for the H.R.I.?

There are some baseless rumors that only one person is working here. We can confirm
that these are untrue. We have more than one member.

### Can you give me back my $20?

No, Dylan. We cannot. Those 20 bucks are essential in the running of our daily
operations. Do not fret, they'll be put to good use.

### How can I join the H.R.I.?

You don't join the H.R.I. The H.R.I. chooses you. But you can always try.
